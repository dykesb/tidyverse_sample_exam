### The certification

The Tidyverse Certification is provided by RStudio and it attests to
your pedagogical skills and knowledge of the Tidyverse ecosystem. To
obtain the certification, the first step is to participate in a one-day
training course that focuses on teaching methodologies. Then, you need
to pass two exams: a teaching exam and a Tidyverse exam. For more
